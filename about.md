I am a postdoctoral researcher working in the Center for Exascale Simulation of Plasma-Coupled Combustion (XPACC) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). My work centers around simulation and modeling of turbulent flow physics in the presence of "additional" physical phenomena, for example, turbulence affected by combustion and laser-induced ignition. This research requires simultaneous foundation in basic physical principles, development of reduced-order models, application of scalable and resilient parallel programming, and deployment on high-performance computing systems.

Originally from central California, U.S.A., I received my B.S. from the University of Notre Dame under the direction of Karel Matou≈°, and I received my M.A. and Ph.D. from Princeton University under the direction of Michael E. Mueller.

I am involved in the academic community, consulting internationally on turbulent combustion and high-performance computing and serving as a referee for numerous peer-reviewed journals. I attend the annual conference of the American Physical Society Division of Fluid Dynamics (APS-DFD), meetings of The Combustion Institute, and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) Conference on Numerical Combustion.
