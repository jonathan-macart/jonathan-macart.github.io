I am currently a postdoctoral research associate in the Center for Exascale Simulation of Plasma-Coupled Combustion (XPACC) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). My work centers around simulation and modeling of turbulent flow in the presence of "additional" physical phenomena, for example, turbulence affected by combustion or laser-induced ignition. This research involves theories obtained from basic physical principles, development of reduced-order models, application of scalable and resilient parallel programming, and deployment on high-performance computing systems.

Originally from central California, I received my B.S. from the University of Notre Dame in 2013 and my Ph.D. from Princeton University in 2018.

I am involved in the academic community, consulting on turbulent combustion and high-performance computing and serving as a referee for several scientific journals. I attend the annual conference of the American Physical Society Division of Fluid Dynamics (APS-DFD), meetings of The Combustion Institute, and the International Conference on Numerical Combustion.

I will start in January 2020 as an assistant professor of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering at the University of Notre Dame. I am looking to hire graduate students and postdocs with interests in numerical simulation of turbulence and a dynamic work environment. Interested individuals should send their CV and a brief statement of intent to [jmacart@nd.edu](mailto:jmacart@nd.edu).
